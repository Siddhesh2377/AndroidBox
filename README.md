# AndroidBox - A Node-Based IDE

AndroidBox is an innovative IDE that utilizes a node-based editor concept, allowing for dynamic conversion between nodes and text code. It aims to provide an enhanced coding experience by combining the best features of block-based and text-based coding methods.

## Key Features

- **Node-to-Text Conversion**: Convert nodes to text code at runtime.
- **Text-to-Node Conversion**: Seamlessly convert text code back into nodes.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Unlike Sketchware, AndroidBox supports text-to-block conversion and offers a versatile coding environment.

## Why AndroidBox?

While tools like Sketchware and Sketchware Pro offer a block-based approach to coding, they lack the ability to convert text into blocks. AndroidBox addresses this limitation by providing:

1. Conversion between text code and nodes.
2. Integration of both block-based and text-based coding methods.

## Future Plans

AndroidBox will include a plugin section where users can download compilers, themes, icons, and syntax highlighters similar to those available in VS Code.
