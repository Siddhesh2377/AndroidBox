# AndroidBox - A Node Based IDE

It is an Ide on Node Editor Concept An can Convert The Node's to text At RunTime, an can convert the
text Code To Node's

it is like **Sketchware** But **Sketchware/Sketchware pro** misses some Features

> 1. Cannot convert text to blocks

> 2. You can Only Add the codes Through Blocks ( At first it supports the feature of a inbuild code
     editor, But now it has Block's name ' COMMAND BLOCKS '


So I am Aiming To Add Those Featues To a single APP
An if I can then i will add a plugins sections were you can download The Compiler, Themes, icons,
Syntex Hilighter Like VS CODE

**HERE IS THE DESIGN**
